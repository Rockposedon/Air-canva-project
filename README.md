# Air Canva on Whiteboard

This project presents a real time video based pointing method which allows sketching and writing text over air in front of camera. Air Canvas is developed for communicating a concept or presenting an idea in the real-world space. Proposed method track the colored object in the camera frames and here color detection and tracking is used in order to achieve the objective. The color marker is detected and a mask is produced. It includes the further
steps of morphological operations on the mask produced which are erosion and dilation and with that whatever you will draw in air will reflect on the whiteboard.
