# Air Canva on Whiteboard

This project presents a real-time video-based pointing method that allows sketching and writing text over the air in front of a camera. Air Canvas is developed for communicating a concept or presenting an idea in real-world space. The proposed method tracks the colored object in the camera frames and here color detection and tracking is used in order to achieve the objective. The color marker is detected and a mask is produced. It includes further
steps of morphological operations on the mask produced which are erosion and dilation and with that whatever you will draw in the air will reflect on the whiteboard.
